Share Hope System 

# Problem Statement

Family values and society as a whole have changed substantially as a result of Bhutan's rapid development over the years. These changes, which are frequently dramatic and traumatic, have pushed a certain segment of the Bhutanese people, particularly the older ones, to the periphery. 

Goensho Tshamkhang was established back in the year 2018 under the supervision of His Majesty the Kingto provide a home to the old and aging population of Bhutan who do not have family members to look after them. The Goensho community has a small infirmary with a few people who are bedridden and in need of medical care, but there are currently no helping hands from the outside community (medication treatment in foreign countries). 

The inability of a person to effectively coordinate a simple donation inspired the development of the system. Today, the Goencho Tshamkhang staff manually organize donation validation, which takes a lot of time and effort. A decent solution must be developed in order to create a web application that acts as a smarter and faster platform for donors to donate. 

Some people might be hesitant to donate money to the welfare home after seeing a donation planned and publicized on social media. The use of this web application will greatly aid in avoiding such problems. Due to the rise in illegal practices by non-integrity individuals the interested donors are reluctant to make the contributions. This application provides a platform for those who are unsure about where to donate or who lack the time to physically deliver their donations.
